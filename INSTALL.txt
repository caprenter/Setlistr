===Setlistr Installation===

==Files==
Place all the files on your webserver.

==Database==
Set up a MySQL database and import the database set up files from the /db directory.

==Configuration==
=Document Root/Base URL=
example.settings.php
Make a copy of example.settings.php and rename it settings.php
Edit settings.php to reflect your server document root
There is also a site email setting which is used in password recovery (new_pass.php)
And a default list id for the API demo page (/api/show.php)

=.htaccess=
You might want to visit the settings in the .htaccess file.

=Database=
Update the database connection information in the following places:
functions/example.connect.php - make a copy of this file and rename it funtions/connect.php then edit your database connection details
phpUserClass/access.class.beta.php - edit this file directly (This file with the connection details still remains in version control as it is likely to change)

=User Passwords=
Passwords by default are salted with a both a site salt and a randomly genarated string.
Set a 'site salt' in:
phpUserClass/access.class.beta.php

If you wish, in phpUserClass/access.class.beta.php you can alter the way site passwords are generated and encrypted.

=Javascript=
You need to edit 'edit in place' javascript function for the editing of set list titles. In:
javascript/script.js
Find the //edit-in-place function and set the url appropriately.

=Google Analytics=
Google Analytics tracking javascript is set in theme/footer.php
Edit this to your needs

=Offline Message=
If the site fails to connect to the database, then it will redirect to offline.php
You can customise this file to reflect your own message. 
To receive the mysql error report edit the lines in the flexibleAccess function in access.class.beta.php

==Clean up==
When anyone visits the site, a new list is generated. 
To clean up old lists, set up a cron job to visit 
clean_up_routine.php
By default this is set to remove lists, and tracks, assigned to user 0, that are older than 2 hours.

==Updating Setlistr==
If you decide to pull files from the GitHub repository you should get conflicts in some of the files with major settings them.
The main ones to watch are:
phpUserClass/access.class.beta.php
javascript/script.js

settings.php and functions/connect.php used to also suffer in the same way, but are now dealt with usinf example files.

Just saying - be careful until we find a way to make this better!
